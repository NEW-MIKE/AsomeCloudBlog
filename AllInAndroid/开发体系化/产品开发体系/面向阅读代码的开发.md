如何通过阅读代码完成自己的开发的任务：

随着蓬勃发展的开源时代的到来，为了减少开发成本，提高开发效率，越来越多的公司使用各种开源项目，作为开发者，如果能充分利用好开源项目中的资源，不仅能提高实践能力，专业知识水平，还能从中其中学到的优秀的架构思想。本文将提供一些学习开源项目的思路，相信看了这篇文章，小白也可学习读懂开源项目，不必再对着高大上的开源项目望而生畏，浅尝辄止。。https://juejin.cn/post/6844903657348022280

我很认同庄表伟总结的 “学习开源，就尽可能在代码里找答案，而不是在代码之外找答案，那些都是二手的，而且很可能是不准确的。” 但是如何读好，读懂代码，我这边还是有不同的认识。https://www.zhihu.com/question/19637879

因此，对于开源项目，不能简单的采取“拿来主义”，而要比较深入的去学习开源项目，做到“知其然，知其所以然”，一方面是为了更好地应用这些开源项目，另一方面也是为了通过学习优秀的开源项目来提升自己的能力。https://time.geekbang.org/column/article/186778
